<h1>basic building blocks</h1>

primitive types:
<ul>
    <li>number</li>
    <li>string</li>
    <li>boolean</li>
    <li>null</li>
    <li>undefined</li>
</ul>

technically there are two others: symbol and BigInt


<h2>numbers</h2>

<ul>
    <li>js has one number type</li>
    <li>positive numbers</li>
    <li>negative numbers</li>
    <li>whole numbers (integers)</li>
    <li>decimal numbers</li>

</ul>

<h3>math operations</h3>

<ul>
    <li>// creates a comment (the line is ignored)</li>
    <li>+, -, *, /, %</li>
    <li>% modulo - remainder

    9 % 2 -> 1
    2 goes into 9 how many times? 4 
    what's the remainder? 1

    19 % 4
    19-16
    3

    to determine if number is even or odd

    even number -> get remainder of 0
    odd -> get 1</li>
<li>** to get power
    2 ** 4 = 2x2x2x2
</li>
</ul>
    

<h4>NaN</h4>

<ul>
    <li>not a number</li>
    <li>is considered a number is js</li>
    <li>NaN is a numeric value that represents something that is...not a number</li>
    <li>example:  0/0 - NaN</li>
    <li>typeof 4 -> "number"</li>
    <li>typeof NaN -> "number"</li>
    <li>0/0 -> NaN</li>
    <li>1 + NaN -> NaN</li>

</ul>

<p>example problems:</p>

<ul>
<li>what does this evaluate to??</li>
4 + 3 * 4 / 2

answer:  10

order of operations applies

<li>(13 % 5) ** 2</li>
5 goes into 13 2 times with a remainder of 3
3x3 = 9


<li>200 + 0/0</li>
if 0/0 is NaN then 200 + NaN = NaN
</ul>

<hr>

variables:
* variables are like labels for values
* we can store a value and give it a name so that we can:
- refer back to it later
- use that value to do stuff
- or change it later on

basic syntax:
key word 'let'

ex:  let year = 1985;

we're registering a variable

ex:  let numHens = 5;
let numRoosters = 1;

numHens + numRoosters
-> 6

numHens +1
-> 6

let totalChickens = numHens + numRoosters;

totalChickens
-> 6

numHens = numHens + 1;
-> 7

<hr>

let score = 0;

score
-> 0

score = 5
-> 5
score = score + 5


more common syntax:
score += 5;
score
-> 60

score += 10;
70

also:
score -= 50;
score
->50

score *= 2;
-> 40

common to increment or decrement by 1

<hr>

let numLives = 9;

numLives -= 1;

numLives--;
8
numLives
7

numLives++;

<hr>

<p>const and var</p>

constant = value that doesn't change

const luckyNum=26;

luckyNum-> 26

can't update/change the const value

why use const?
can store values we know won't change
maybe store miles to feet

const feetInMile = 5280;

once we cover arrays & objects, we'll see other situations where const makes sense over let

<hr>
 v a r 
 still works, but it's the old way

 var runDistance = 26.2;
 
no reason to use var 

<hr>

<p>booleans</p>
true and false

variables can change typeslet numPuppies = 23; // number
numPuppies = false; // now a boolean 
numPuppies = 100; // back to number

it doesn't make sense to chanage from a number to a boolean but we can

<hr>

<p>naming variables</p>

let current_date - snake case (not commonly used)

let currentDate - camel case

<hr>

<p>strings</p>
<ul>
    <li>another primitive type</li>
    <li>textual information</li>
    <li>can be a single character long</li>
    <li>can be zero characters long, empty string</li>
    <li>can be long</li>

</ul>

<p>strings are indexed - every character in a string has a corresponding number associated with it</p>
positional number starting at zero
left to right

let phone = (123) 456-7890

phone[0]
"("

"lol".length
3

we can add strings together
"lol" + "lol"
"lollol"
concatination

can't change a string

let firstName = "River"
let lastName = "Phoenix"

let fullName = firstName + lastName
"RiverPhoneix"

fullName
"RiverPhoenix"


<hr>
<p>string methods</p>
built-in actions we can perform with individual strings
they help us do things like:
- searching within a string
- replacing part of a string
- changing the casing of a string

thing.method ()

let msg = "leave me alone"

msg.toUpperCase()

"LEAVE ME ALONE"

nondesctructive method

let angryMsg = msg.toUpperCase()

angryMsg
"LEAVE ME ALONE"

msg 
"leave me alone"

<p>trim</p>
trims off any white space at the beginning or end of a string

useful for input data from user

let userInput = "    hello"

userInput.trim()
"hello"

doesn't remove other characters

we can chain methods together

let greeting = "  hello"

greeting.trim().toUpperCase()
"HELLO"

<hr>

<p>arg</p>

thing.method(arg)
some methods accept arguments that modify their behavior
think of them as inputs that we can pass in 
we pass these arguments inside of the parentheses 

example:

let tvShow = 'catdog';

tvShow.indexOf('cat'); // 0
tvShow.indexOf('dog'); // 3
tvShow.indexOf('z'); // -1 (not found)

returns first occurence

<p>slice</p>
slice actually can accept more than one argumentslook at the docs

extract or slice a portion of a string and gives us a new string

str.slice(beginIndex[, endIndex])

endIndex is optional

example: 
let msg = "haha that is so funny!".slice(5);
-> 'that is so funny!'

msg.slice(5, 9)
-> "that"

can you negative numbers it just works backwards

<p>replace</p>

need to pass in 2 arguments
1) what we're trying to replace
2) what we want to replace it with

msg.replace('haha', 'lololol')
-> 'lololol that is so funny!'

also a replace all method
but not fully implemented these days

<p>repeat</p>

"lol".repeat(10)

repeats 10 times


<hr>

<p>string template literals</p>
- must use back-tick key 
``````````
${}
treated as an expression then evaluated
not evaluated as a string

`hello ${1+2}`
-> hello 3

example:
"you bought " + qty + " " + product + ". Total is: " + price * qty

`You bought ${qty} ${product}. Total is: ${price * qty}`
-> "You bought 5 Artichoke. Total is: $11.25"

<hr>

<p>null & undefined</p>

<ul>
    <li>null - intentional absence of any value, must be assigned</li>
    <li>undefined - variables that do not have an assigned value are undefined</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>math object</p>

- contains properties and methods for mathematical constants and functions

Math.floor (23.90)
-> 23

chops it off

Math.ceil (34.1)
-> 35
rounds up no matter what

maybe not that useful on their own

<p>random numbers</p>

Math.random() gives us a random decimal between 0 and 1 (non-inclusive)

maybe random number between 1 and 2 (like heads or tails)

<p>random integers between 1 and 5</p>

Math.random() *5
Math.floor(Math.radom() *5)
Math.floor(Math.radom() *5) + 1

0 to 5

add +1 to shift up

<hr>
<p>exercise</p>
I've provided you with two variables, die1 and die2 which represent six-sided dice.  Each variable holds a randomly generated integer from 1 to 6.  Please create a new variable called roll, which will be a string that displays each die as well as their sum.  Follow this pattern:

die1: 3

die2: 5

roll: "You rolled a 3 and a 5. They sum to 8"

Here is another example with different numbers:

die1: 6

die2: 4,

roll: You rolled a 6 and a 4. They sum to 10"

const die1 = Math.floor(Math.random() *6) +1;
const die2 = Math.floor(Math.random() *6) + 1;
const roll = `You rolled a ${die1} and a ${die2}. They sum to ${die1 + die2}`;

"You rolled a 3 and a 5. They sum to 8"
